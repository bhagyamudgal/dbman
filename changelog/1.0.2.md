# Version 1.0.2

## New Features

- **Interactive Connection Management**: Added a `config manage` command that provides a user-friendly interactive menu to add, list, remove, rename, and set default connections.
- **Session Management**: The CLI now tracks an "active" connection for your session. The `connect` command sets this active connection, which is then used by other commands.
- **Status Command**: Introduced a `status` command to display both the globally configured default connection and the session-specific active connection.
- **Disconnect Command**: Added a `disconnect` command to clear the active session and revert to using the default connection.
- **Database Override**: The `query` and `list` commands now support a `--database` flag to temporarily switch to a different database without changing the saved connection details.

## Improvements

- **Rename Connections**: Added a `config rename` command to allow users to rename existing connections. The command interactively prompts for the connection to rename.
- **Config Path**: Added a `config path` command to easily locate the configuration file.
- **Connect Command**: The `connect` command now prompts users to select from a list of saved connections or create a new one, improving workflow and reducing errors.

## Bug Fixes

- **Circular Dependency**: Resolved a circular dependency between `config.ts` and `session.ts` by moving shared constants to a separate `constants.ts` file.
- **Duplicate Save**: Fixed an issue where the `connect` command would re-save an existing connection when selected.
