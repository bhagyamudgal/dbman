## Version 1.0.3

This version focuses on major stability improvements and increased test coverage.

### Fixed

- Resolved persistent memory leaks and hanging processes in the Vitest test suite by fixing an infinite loop in the `manage` command's test and ensuring proper resource cleanup.
- Corrected several test failures caused by improper mocking of ESM modules, particularly `fs` and `@inquirer/prompts`.
- Stabilized the test environment by adding `process.exit` spies to tests expecting failures, preventing the test runner from crashing.
- Modified the `stdin` handling for child processes (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) to `ignore` instead of `inherit`, preventing deadlocks in the non-interactive test environment.

### Added

- Significantly improved test coverage for the `dump` and `restore` commands, adding tests for numerous edge cases, including:
    - No databases or dump files found.
    - Dump file verification failures.
    - User cancellation of confirmation prompts.
    - Invalid user input in interactive flows.
- Added a global test timeout to `vitest.config.ts` to prevent any future tests from hanging indefinitely.

### Changed

- Updated the `pnpm test` script to include the `run` command, ensuring Vitest exits automatically after tests are complete.
- Removed the unnecessary `--max-old-space-size` flag from the test script, as the underlying memory leaks have been fixed.
